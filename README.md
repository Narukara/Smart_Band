## 北航电子创新大赛项目 band

Here is the source code of the band. The band is based on ESP32. Contains drivers for MAX30102, MPU6050, and SSD1306.

The band implements functions such as wearing detection, heart rate detection, body temperature detection, and step counting. The collected data can be displayed on the OLED screen or sent to the mobile app via the MQTT protocol.

The Android app is very simple, so I won’t put it here. The app is basically based on my [IOT-homework](https://github.com/Narukara/IOT-homework).
